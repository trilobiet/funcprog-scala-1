PROBLEM
=======
CalculatorSuite isn't able to import any of the source files (TweetLength, Calculator, Polynomial), as a result, every test is failing. Could someone please help troubleshoot this?

SOLUTION (IntelliJ):
====================
1. Right-click the "calculator [progfun2-calculator]", and click "Open Module Settings"

2. "Project Settings" -> "Modules" -> "progfun2-calculator" -> "Dependencies" -> "+" in the bottom -> "Module Dependency..." -> Select "shared-sources" -> "OK" -> "OK"

And now the "TweetLength" in your "CalculatorSuite" will no longer in Red.
